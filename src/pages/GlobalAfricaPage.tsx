      <p className="mb-4">
        The story of Black Americans is deeply intertwined with the African continent, where their ancestors were forcibly taken during the transatlantic slave trade. 
        Despite the brutality of slavery, African cultural traditions, music, food, and spiritual practices were preserved and adapted in the Americas.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Great Migration in the early 20th century saw millions of African Americans move from the rural South to urban centers in the North, bringing with them 
        rich cultural traditions that would shape American music, literature, and civil rights movements.

      <p className="mb-4">
        Brazil received more African slaves than any other country in the Americas, and today has the largest population of African descendants outside of Africa. 
        This profound influence is evident in Brazil's music, dance, religion, and cuisine.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Cultural expressions like samba, capoeira, and Candomblé all have strong African roots and continue to be celebrated as vital parts of Brazilian identity.

        Haïti made history in 1804 as the first independent nation in Latin America and the Caribbean, the second republic in the Americas, 
        and the first country in the modern world to be governed by former slaves.

      <p className="mb-4">
        The Haitian Revolution was a defining moment in the history of the African diaspora, inspiring enslaved people throughout the Americas and

        Jamaica's cultural identity is deeply rooted in its African heritage, particularly through the Maroons, escaped slaves who established 
        independent communities in the island's mountainous interior.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Rastafari movement, which emerged in Jamaica in the 1930s, looks to Africa as the spiritual homeland and has had a profound influence 
        on global music, particularly through reggae and the message of artists like Bob Marley.
